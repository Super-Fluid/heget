        Abstract: Heqet is a Haskell library which converts music 
        data created by the Euterpea library into code suitable
        as input to the Lilypond music notation software. Heqet
        also provides a domain-specific language for entering music
        directly in Haskell code, which resembles Lilypond notation
        but diverges somewhat in accordance with how Heqet approaches
        music, in particular, in that Heqet takes a more abstract view
        of music, while Lilypond mixes music and its notation. In contrast,
        Euterpea has an extremely abstract model of music, putting Heqet in
        the middle. Creating a score is complicated and requires some
        human intervention in assigning staves, meters, and clefs, etc. To aid
        this effort, Heqet provides functions for manipulating music data
        succinctly, automating these tasks as much as possible, and providing
        the power to easily express complex transformations useful for composing
        and arranging. Heqet also provides Haskell lenses for viewing and 
modifying music data, which allows multiple criteria for the 
desired fragment of music to be composed. It's possible to define
custom pitch types which can be mixed with other types of pitch
freely, to include arbitrary Lilypond tweaks, and to define your
own instruments, complete with playability evaluation.
