<center><h1>Heqet</h1></center>
<h3>Isaac Reilly's senior project in Computer Science at Yale University</h3>

        Heqet can convert music from Euterpea, manipulate it,
        and generate code for displaying it with Lilypond as
        a printed score.
        
        If you want to use Heqet, clone this repository (on the master branch)
        and run "cabal build". You might need to install Control.Lens first
        with "cabal install lens". Then check out my
