\begin{section}{Heqet for Euterpea Users}
Given a Euterpea music expression, creating a score is
 straightforward. You will need to import \verb+Heqet+ 
 and \verb+Heqet.Input.Euterpea+ and then apply the following functions:
First, to convert it to a Heqet music value, 
you should use \verb+fromEu+ or \verb+fromEu1+, which take a Euterpea \verb+Music Pitch+ or a \verb+Music Note1+ respectively. Now you can print a score to
 stdout with the functions \verb+quickScore+ or \verb+quickLine+. \verb+quickScore+ produces a piano rendition, while \verb+quickLine+ writes a single staff. 
 
 The reason that these functions perform IO is that the 
 simplest way to use Heqet here is to write a Haskell program which outputs your Lilypond code and 
 pipe it directly into Lilypond, which you can do by running the included \verb+heqet.sh+ bash script with your Haskell program filename as an argument. Alternatively, just load your program into GHCi and paste the output code into a Lilypond file.

Now, suppose you have a score that has multiple instruments and you want to write them on separate staves with appropriate labels. If your Euterpea doesn't have instrument modifiers, you'll have to assign instruments in Heqet.

\begin{subsection}{Differences from Lilypond input}
There are several differences between the Heqet note-input domain-specific language and Lilypond input, for a variety of reasons. 
\begin{itemize}
\item You can enter notes with any rational duration with the \verb+\d+ syntax, for example \verb+c\d 4/5+ to make a note with a duration of $4/5$ of a WHAT. You can omit the denominator if it's $1$. This is currently the only way to enter notes of the durations needed for a tuplet. 

\item \verb+hz+

\item \verb+c-(+ for slurs (sorry)

\item no clefs or time signatures

\item functions, commands, \verb+\with+ . Lilypond parsing problems

\item only absolute entry at the moment. 

\item percussion notation \verb+\phh+ for hi-hat. When you enter notes, you don't need to specify that they must be rendered in a DrumStaff. They should be automatically rendered well, although support for percussion is currently minimal.

\item no way to manually write beams, as this is not something the musician should need to worry about.
